# Machine-Learning-Basics

The road-map is divided into 6 sections. They are:

1. Mathematics
2. Python/R
3. Machine Learning Algorithms
4. Deep Learning Algorithms
5. Computer Vision
6. Natural Language Processing

In detailed description of them:

1. Mathematics
   a. Linear Algebra

3. Machine Learning Algorithms
   a. Regression, Classification, Clustering, Gradient Descent
   b. Optimisations
   c. Bayesian Methods, Time Series, Ensemble Algorithms
   d. Libraries: sci-kit learn, graphlab.

4. Deep Learning Algorithms
   a. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Activation Functions, Dropout
   b. Convolution Neural Networks (CNN)
   c. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
   d. Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) Long-short term memory Networks (LSTMN)
   e. Deep Belief Networks
   f. Transfer Learning and other advanced concepts such as R - CNN, F - RCNN
   g. Frameworks: Tensorflow, Keras, Pytorch, Caffe, gym by openai.

5. Computer Vision
   a. Open-CV
   b. Pattern Recognition
   c. Segmentation
   d. Object detection

6. Natural Language Processing
   a. Tokenization, Stemming and Lemmatizing
   b. POS (Part of Speech)
   c. NER (Named Entity Recognition)
   d. TF-IDF
   e. word2vec

These all are pure mathematical topics, implement all of them at least once.
